# Playstore-Apps-Analysis-and-Visualization
This Project contains real-world dataset of the google play store, one of the most used applications for downloading android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights and visualizing the data .

**Project Description**:
This project will help to understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool.

The Project consist of 2 modules:
**Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.**
      Data Pre-processing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data will be used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, datatype transformation, removing duplicates.
Data is analyzed using SQL by querying and retrieving desired data from database.

**Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.**
  In this module, using both datasets for visualizing what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. creating a dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis.
